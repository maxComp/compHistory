Customer demand for service from Idaho Power  Co.'s system set a single-hour peak record Monday, company officers said.
President T. E. Roach said the single-hour peak was 1,006,000 kilowatts. He said this broke the previous mark of 
1,003,000 kilowatts which was set Friday.
The Friday peak was the first time in Idaho s 50-year history the peak had surpassed one million kilowatts.
"Our peak load can be expected to go even higher before the end of the summer as the economy continues to 
grow and if there is no change in the weather," Roach said.
Hot and dry weather was responsible for a "large part" of speak load increase, Roach said.
He said there had been heavy demands for power by electric  irrigators in the Snake River Valley and that 
stepped up production by phosphate processors also shared in boosting the load to a new high.
