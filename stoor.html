Mr. Gerald E. Stoor, CDP worked for the Idaho Transportation Department in the Planning Survey section during the late 1950’s,  58-59 as a Statistician.  The Idaho State Highway Department had installed a Univac 120 computer and the road planning section was allowed to use the system during slack time and after hours.  A systems analyst from Univac was assigned to work with the department to help program and implement some applications.  Mr. Stoor was assigned to support  the systems analyst and get training for the Univac 120.
<br><br>In the early part of 1960 Mountain States Wholesale ordered a Univac 60 computer system and was looking for a manager to implement and operate a new data processing system for them.   Mountain States had constructed a new warehouse with plans to move their entire grocery operation in the late fall of 1960. 
Mr. Stoor started work in the new facility on June 1, 1960.  His first task was to hire additional help for data acquisition.  Additional training and help in programming and operations was provided by Univac.  Systems design and programming was started on inventory control, customer invoicing, purchasing and customer statements.  At that time Mountain States serviced several hundred independent customers in Idaho, Eastern Oregon and Northern Nevada as well as local chain stores like Albertsons and M & W. 
<br><br>Mr. Stoor joined the local National Machine Accountants Association in 1961, which was later renamed the Data Processing Management Association. He held several offices as well as President in 1964.  He also successfully passed the Certified Data Processors exam administered by DPMA.
<br><br>As time allowed Mountain States eventually added all of the accounting functions found in a major grocery wholesale operation as well as those of the subsidiary Drug Sundries Division.
The system was upgraded to a Univac 1004 when it was announced.  Later the system was upgraded to an IBM 360-30 when the company was acquired by Di-Gorgio, headquarters in San Francisco California.
<br><br>He left Mountain Sates Wholesale in 1969 when he went to work for the Univac branch office in Portland and became the local Boise manager for Univac.  He was with Univac as resident sales manager selling and upgrading several systems in Idaho until he left in 1974, when he purchased his own business Stoor’s Inc.  DBA Spring Shores Marina.
