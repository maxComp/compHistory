<b>Auditor Gains Data Processing Control To Centralize Operation Within Idaho</b><br>Idaho Statesman March 26, 1971

</center><br>

A centralized data processing and uniform accounting system for state government will be implemented under Jurisdiction of the state auditor, Gov. Cecil D. Andrus announced Thursday.
<br><br>Auditor Joe R. Williams will have nearly, $1 million under his control to set up and administer the system and carry on the normal functions of his office.

<br><br>Approval of the shift of control from the Department of Administrative Services was given by the State Board of Examiners. 
<br><br>Williams, a Democrat, had battled with the Department of Administrative Services over accounting and data processing since the agency was created by the 1967 Legislature.  The department was under control of former Gov. Don W. Samuelson, a Republican, and the Republican controlled legislature had given it the funds.
