<center><b>Load Forecasting</b></center>

<p>

Accurate models for electric power load forecasting are essential to the
operation and planning of a utility company. Load forecasting helps an
electric utility to make important decisions including decisions on purchasing and generating electric power, load switching, and infrastructure
development. Load forecasts are extremely important for energy suppliers, 
ISOs, financial institutions, and other participants in electric energy
generation, transmission, distribution, and markets.
