Development and successful marketing of computer services with broad applications in business 
and industry have led to the formation of Boise Cascade Computing. Incorporated, a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of Boise Cascade Corporation.<br>
Ralph Hull, who heads up Borse Cascade Computing, said his firm was created with the advantages 
of 130 highly trained, experienced people and a data processing center containing one of the finest 
hardware capabilities I've seen in such an operation.<br>
BCCI evolved from Boise Cascade's former Central Computing Department as a result of innovation on
 the part of two individuals who tackled what experts in the field had described as the impossibles 
The two-Ron Hoppins, who was 26 at the time and Noah Tadlock Jr, who was 23-developed a 
successful system for converting existing computer programs to fit newer, faster computers.<br>
This first system. Exodus I. was developed in 1967. It converts IBM Model 1410 computer 
programs to fit third generation IBM S/360 computers and was marketed under a royalty 
agreement by Computer Sciences Corporation, putting Boise Cascade in the computer software
 business for the first time.<br>
The two young programmers then took on the assignment of developing a conversion system for Model 1401 
computer there were about 10 times many 1401 computers us around the country as the were 1410's. Again
 they were successful, and Boise Cascade introduced another revolutionary system. Exodus II, also marketed 
by Computer Sciences Corporation.<br>
Our first conversion program put us in a third generation computer operating environment years ahead of 
another third-generation user, Hull stated. "We have been this advanced multiprogramming environment for 
a full three years"<br>
Hull said the new company has another unusual capability "We have married the traditional data processing
 function with the communication function, both voice and teleprocessing This has allowed us to develop such 
programs as communication cost analysis, which can be used to advantage by any corporation which has scattered 
locations."<br>
He added that he believes teleprocessing will replace VOICE communication as the major factor in transmittal 
of business information within the next Few years" In anticipation of this, BCCI operates teleprocessing terminals
 in five West Coast cities and Chicago.
<br>
New applications of traditional computer functions are continually being developed, according to Hull. He listed 
as an example an on-line order entry system which eliminates numeric coding and makes information accessible 
in language a reader can understand without special training. Other systems under development will allow 
customers to interact or "Converse" with computers to arrive at quick solutions to complex problems He said 
BCCI is developing an on-line capability second to none.<br>
Recently, a new service was put on the market It is called COMIT - Computer Operations Management. Information 
and Training - and it is already successfully operating in several data processing installations COMIT is designed to aid EDP centers with personnel develop mert, input and output controls, operating controls, documentation and scheduling of computer operations.
<br>
Hull said the average personnel turnover in the computing services business is close to 100 per cent every 18 months
 "We've experienced practically no turnover in past years, and this gives us a continuity which few other companies in 
the business are able to match," he stated.
"Our goal is to be the best in the business, and we're not going to compromise," he concluded "We will not accept a job 
unless we know we can show results"
