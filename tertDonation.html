<center><b>Anonymous Donor Gives College of Idaho Univac Computer Valued at $100,000</b><br>Idaho Statesman December 7, 1966</center>
<br><br><p> 
A Univac 1005 computer system, valued at approximately $100,000, will be installed at the College of Idaho within the next week, the gift of an anonymous donor, Dr. Warren B. Knox, C of I president, announced Wednesday.
<br><br>
In expressing his appreciation for the gift, Dr. Knox commented that very few colleges of the size of the C of I are fortunate enough to have such equipment, "The facility will beneficial to administrative procedures, as well as an attraction for academic projects," he said.
The Univac 1005, a data processing system, consists of three major units of electronic equipment, transistorized (for efficiency), it does not require extensive installation, present personnel at the college will be trained in its use, according to Eldon R, Marsh, business manager.
<br><br>
Initially the Univac will be used in handling student records in the admissions office, registrar's office and business office. Academic use of the equipment also is being considered, perhaps on a project basis for students in mathematics, physics, Business  Administration and other departments, Marsh added.
The 1005 processor is an extremely complex processing unit, combining multiple program-controlled functions in a single unit. It has a photo-electric card reader, high-speed printer, core memory, and associated arithmetic logic and control circuitry.
This consolidation offers virtual singlepoint operational and supervisory control of the entire system, providing the optimum in functional flexibility and operator efficiency, Marsh said.
