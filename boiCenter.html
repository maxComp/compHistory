<center><b>Bank Data Center </b><br>
Idaho Statesman May 29, 1966</center><br><br>
<p>
Early this year, Bank of Idaho began the initial operations of phasing in central automated bookkeeping utilizing a B-300 Burroughs transistorized digital data processing computer. 
The unit is the first of its kind in the Pacific Northwest and consists of six major elements; a central processor, MICR - (magnetic ink character recognition) sorter reader, card reader,
 diskfile, line printer and magnetic tape units, each contained in separate but interconnecting housings,
the central processor is the heart of the computer. All commands are initially fed into this component which contains nearly ten thousand letters or digits of information in magnetic core storage. It can add, subtract, multiply or divide 16,000 figures in 60 seconds.
The MICR-sorter/reader magnetizes iron oxide particles in the special ink now imprinted on all checks and sorts them at a rate of 23 checks per second.
<br><br>
The magnetic tape unit feeds all the information contained on a half mile of magnetic tape in five minutes and rewinds it in 90 seconds.
The card reader can transfer all the information such as the name, address and phone number of 2100 different people from punched cards to tape in 60 seconds.
The disk-file is like a huge phonograph record with the needle for every groove. It can isolate and retrieve any individual's bank record in twenty one-thousandths of a second. It will contain all the information on all Bank of Idaho checking accounts.  The line-printer is a high speed typewriter device which prints an entire line of type at Once rather than one letter at a time, it prints 700 lines per minute and can print text equivalent to 40 pages in a normal book in 60 seconds. Customers' bank statements are printed at the rate of 1 per second.
<br><br>
Special quarters have been prepared for the data processing equipment on the second floor of the head office building at Capitol Boulevard and Idaho Streets in Boise. The glass-enclosed computer room is equipped with special equipment to maintain constant temperature and humidity
Bianco said, "This data processing is the latest addition to Bank of Idaho's program of maintaining facilities to provide the most complete modern and convenient metropolitan banking service to all customers at all our branches throughout the state, Idaho is growing at an increasing rate, Bank of Idaho's data-processing facility is designed and programmed to accommodate this anticipated expansion of financial activity."
