Night school offerings were increased at Boise Junior College Wednesday as two new courses were added, 
Introduction to Data Automation and Personal Income Tax Problems, James R. Wolfe, director of the evening program, 
announced Wednesday. The automation class is a general interest course offered to acquaint students 
with the fundamentals and principles upon which automation is based. The logic and reasoning processes 
utilized in data automation are also explored, said Wolfe. This new course is designed for three 
hours a week for two semesters and will be conducted by two instructors. The primary instructor, 
Russell Brubaker, is a systems engineer with International Business Machines. He will conduct 
classroom instruction. Howard Crow, systems analyst with Univac Corporation for two years, will act as 
consultant and evaluator. During the second semester the instructors will exchange positions, Wolfe said.
