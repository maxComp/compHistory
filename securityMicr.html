<center><b>Bank to Use Electronics On Checks</b><br>Idaho Statesman September 16, 1964</center>
<p>First Security notes "Computer Center" to be put in service,
Idaho's first electronic data processing bank computer will be put into service Monday at the main Boise office of the 
First Security Bank of ldaho, V. R. Steffensen, president, said Tuesday.<br><br>

All checks and deposits drawn in or credited to customer accounts during the business day for offices of First Security Bank of Idaho are captured and balanced on the data processing system in Boise. This information is then transmitted from disc storage over telephone lines to magnetic tape at the bank’s Salt Lake City computer center.
The data is then sorted and posted to customer accounts on the systern in a matter of minutes and new trial balance and report information is transmitted back to the Boise computer center. The printed trial balances and reports are prepared before the start of the next business day for tellers and bank officers at all offices served by the computer.
Paper checks and deposits are electronically sorted for filing by the processing system at Boise.<br><br>

The equipment is provided by International Business Machines on a rental basis. It has been installed in a 1,000 square foot room in the basement of the bank’s office building which formerly housed the real estate and installment loan departments.
Those departments have been moved to remodeled quarters on the ground floor of the building. A variety store was formerly located in that area.
In describing the ability of the computing equipment to work at high speeds. Steffensen noted the printer could print the 1,037 page text of the novel “Gone With the Wind” in less than two hours. The printer, used for reports and trial balances, can produce 400 lines of up to 144 characters of information per minute.
He noted data will be recorded on disc packs similar to phonograph records which are so compact the entire text of a book could be recorded on two packs and “read” by the computer in less than two minutes.
