<b>Data Processing Class </b><br>
Idaho Statesman March 21, 1966</center>
<br>
 
The ins and outs of Data Processing were shown to Jill Halmark and Gary Powers, Borah High School students, by Jim Barnes,
systems analyst for the Department of Employment, as a preview to an orientation class in electronic data processing sponsored
by the Central Idaho Chapter of the Data Processing Management Association.  The association has begun the class for 45 Boise 
High School students to stimulate interest in data processsing and to point out career opportunities in the field.
