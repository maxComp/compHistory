At Morrison-Knudsen Co., computers assist engineering management decisions. A modeling system used for several 
years is "project control," which gives' managers some advantage of hindsight before a project is started, 
according to Steve McIntyre, manager of data processing.
<p>"With this you can easily play the game of (what ifs..)" he said. For example, a particular 
construction job is programmed for normal conditions. Then managers may see what delays are incurred if, 
for example, a strike occurs, or if a shipment of equipment is delayed. "lt could take months to figure 
out some of these "what ifs" by hand, but with a computer you have the 
answer in five minutes," he said.
