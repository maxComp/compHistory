The <b>IBM 1130</b>, introduced in 1965, was IBM's least expensive computer at that time. It was aimed at price-sensitive, computing-intensive technical markets like education and engineering.

The 1130 was also used as an intelligent front-end for attaching an IBM 2250 Graphics Display Unit, or as remote job entry (RJE) workstation, connected to a System/360 mainframe.
