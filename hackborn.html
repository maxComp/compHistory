<b>HP unit to mean 400 jobs </b><br>

Idaho Statesman September 2, 1976<br><br>

Hewlett-Packard Co. officials marked the third anniversary of the California electronics firm's Boise plant Wednesday 
by announcing plans to move another manufacturing division, entailing 400 jobs, to Boise.<br><br>
The Disc Memory Division, now located in Cupertino, Calif., will be moved to Boise in phases with full 
production using 400 employes by the fall of 1978, said Dick Hackborn, division manager.
Hackborn told a press conference about 80 engineers and technical designers will be transferred from the 
Bay area. The rest will be hired locally.<br><br>
The new division will design, manufacture and market the company's new disc memory products for computers.
The new division will double the number of Hewlett-Packard employes in Boise and add about a $5-million 
annual payroll when fully staffed, Hackborn said.<br><br>
The division is being transferred to take advantage of the similarities between it and the current Boise 
plant which manufactures and sells computer line printers and magnetic tape drives, he said.
The current H-P plant is a leased 91,000-square-foot building on North Phillippi.<br><br>
A $7-million plant is scheduled for completion in October five miles west of Boise on Highway 20.
Hackborn said the Disc Memory Division will move into the North Phillippi site when the current 
operation moves out.
Ultimately the new division will be housed in another $5.5-million building to be constructed on the same 
site as the new plant, he said

In the Spring of 1992 Dave Packard came to Boise Idaho to offer the chairmanship, presidency and CEO title to Dick Hackborn.
On May 13, 1992 Hackborn wrote Packard a letter turning down the job offer.<br><br>
After getting that letter Packard returned to Boise with Bill Hewlett.  In this meeting Packard said he would move the company's
headquarters to Boise if Hackborn would take the job. The meeting went on for hours, but Hackborn said no a second time.<br><br>

 He became chairman of the board in January 2000.
