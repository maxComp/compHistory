The Multnomah Data Processing Center of Portland announces that it plans to open a branch service office in Boise on September 1. It will be staffed by one resident employe at the outset, and will be located in the downtown area.
James O. Powell, president of the center, says the Boise branch will be the first of several field offices contemplated in the Pacific Northwest. "We expect to employ at least 10 persons in the new Idaho Data Processing Center within a year," he said.
