<b>Ore-Ida Foods Plans to Establish Corporate Headquarters in Boise</b><br>Idaho Statesman January 3, 1968
<p>

Ore-Ida Foods, Inc., announced plans Tuesday to move its corporate headquarters from Ontario to Boise late this summer. About 75 of the firm's 1,200 Ontario employes will be affected.
Ore-Idaho Chairman Frank Armour Jr. said the exact location of the new headquarters in Boise has not been decided but that several locations are under consideration.
<br><br>The firm's sales and marketing group 
specialized management talent from other sections of the country and will facilitate company communications and travel, he said. The choice of Boise for Ore-Ida's new
management headquarters is largely based on its proximity to company production centers and growing operations in the Ontario and Burley areas, Armour said.
