The <b>NCR 315</b> Data Processing System, introduced in January 1962, was a second-generation computer. 
All printed circuit boards used resistor-transistor logic to create the various logic elements. 
Basic memory was 5k of hand-made core memory, which was expandable 
to a maximum of 40k. Some devices like magnetic tape and the CRAM were daisy-chained to allow 
multiple drives to be connected.<p>
The computer was located on the second floor of their office on 16th and State.
