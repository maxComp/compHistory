<center><b>Research Team Reviews Log Distribution Problem</b><br>
Idaho Statesman October 5, 1965</center><br>





<p>
The Boise Cascade Corp.'s operation's research department has been assigned this task and its computers are busy turning 
out profit-making answers.

<br><br>
A little Over a year ago, Boise Cascade Corp Operation's Research Department was formed. A group of young analytical 
experts were recruited and placed under the supervision of the department manager, Robert Donnelly. One of the 
first problems taken on by the yet-to-be-proved infant of the corporation, was to study the log allocation problem 
in its lumber and plywood mills. "What logs should be sent to plywood plants? More explicitly, with limited timber 
supplies, what logs should be diverted from the sawmills and what should be done with the logs remaining at 
the sawmills?" Donnelly, in asking the questions, knew he was leaping right into the middle of a hotly debated 
subject backed by many years of traditional dependence on individuals and their know-how in specialized fields.

<br><br>
It was at this point that a paradoxical feature unique to Boise Cascade Corp. came into play. What appeared to be an 
Ominous intrusion by a group of "youngsters" armed with an idea and backed by the wisdom of a cold, mechanical 
computer obviously had to be "sold" not only to management but to the workers. These workers included everyone 
from log cutters to mill foremen and managers. In line with Boise Cascade President Robert V. Hansberger's 
philosophy of decentralization within the Organization, the experiment was allowed to continue but with the 
understanding that the findings of the new department would be used as a tool to augment established methods 
rather than "take over." 
<br><br>The initial study at the Yakima, Wash., plants of Boise Cascade showed the matter of 
log allocation was a linear programming type of problem,  a mathematical technique solvable on medium to large 
computers. Numerous statistics had to be compiled on punch cards to be fed into the machines. Following the Yakima study, 
plans were made for practical application of the findings. It was decided to make a test on plants near the corporation 
headquarters in Boise.

<br><br>
"We feel we are at least two years ahead of our competitors in the forest products industry - and, in some respects, 
ahead of all industry," Donnelly said. Already the success of the linear programming in log allocation has resulted 
in the Operation's Research Department being assigned to tasks in other divisions.
The historical concept of the computer as an accounting machine will soon be changed so that it will also be 
looked on a reliable forecaster of information, according to the staff of the Operation's Research Department.
