<b>New System To Process State Data</b><br>Idaho Statesman September 30, 1964
</center><br>
 State Auditor Joe Williams announced Tuesday that an IBM data processing system recently installed in his office 
will go into operation Oct. 5.  It will replace two 403 TAB machines that have been in use since June, 1960.  
Williams said installation of the new computer is the first step in the direction of establishment of a general 
central accounting system and will allow his office to take over the routine bookkeeping duties of various 
state agencies. <br><br>He said the state will pay $3,700 a month for the machine compared with $1,700 for the old system 
but that the greater efficiency and speed of the machine will more than offset the difference in cost.<br><br>
He said because the system requires fewer operators, he will not have to replace two members of his staff who 
recently resigned.
Williams said the machines receive data, process it, store it for easy access and prepare paychecks, business 
report and analyses.
"The new system," he said, will provide more accurate  counting of receipts and expenditures of state money and 
allow us to make available for the legislature up-to-the-minute financial management data.
