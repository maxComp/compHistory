<b>Drawing Slated By Department On Permit Hunts</b><br>Idaho Statesman July 19, 1965

</center><br>


Drawings for winners of controlled moose, sheep and goat hunting permits are scheduled at 2 p.m. today 
in the Idaho Fish and Game Department's new headquarters. Drawings for antelope, deer and elk hunting 
permits will be held Wednesday in the new building at East Park Blvd. and Walnut St. - at the site 
of the old Pioneer League baseball park.<br><br> Names of winners will be released to newspapers 
within hours, said Claude Clapsaddle, data processing supervisor, but winners probably will not 
receive notification from the department for about 10 days, Clapsaddle said data processing machines 
will speed up the work but some auditing and handling will be required.
