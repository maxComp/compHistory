<center><b>Boise Cascade Men Develop Computer System</b><br>Idaho Statesman March 19, 1967</center><br>
<p>
Boise Cascade Corporation has gone into a computer sideline thanks to two young employees at its local office. 
The employees - Ron T. Hoppins, age 26, and Noah W. Tadlock Jr., age 23, - have invented a system which converts 
existing computer programs to fit some new, faster computers. <br><br>The story of the young men's accomplishment was 
published in Tuesday's Wall Street Journal. Boise Cascade's stock immediately rose by two points on the New York 
Stock Exchange. Hoppins and Tadlock were told by International Business Machine Corp. (IBM) some time ago that 
the programs now inside Boise Cascade's 1410 computer could not be converted into programs for the new 
IBM model 360 computer. 
<br><br>After two months of work, the pair solved the problem with a new system. They call 
it Exodus and the Boise-based firm will sell it to other companies for $9,000.
Company officials say that about 500 Exodus systems could be sold in the United States. The system consists 
of a 100-page manual and 8,000 punched cards.
Exodus saved $150,000 for Boise Cascade by converting the company's 428 computer programs. It probably saved 
13,000 hours of programmer time which can now be devoted to other projects.
<br><br>Computer Science Corp, a Los Angeles computer services concern, is handling the marketing of Exodus in 
return for 33 per cent of the sale price.
Hoppins and Tadlock now are working on another system to convert programs from the Model 1401, which is 
smaller than the 1410, to the 360.
Computer Sciences already has reserved the right of first refusal on this latest system. There are at 
least seven times as many 1401 computers installed as there are 1410's.
<br><br>Both men were given promotions and raises for their efforts. In addition, Boise Cascade President 
Robert Hansberger presented them each with 100 shares of Boise Cascade stock, worth about $2,800. 
Tadlock said he has purchased a clothes drier with his additional money and Hoppins is considering 
trading in his motorcycle for a bigger model.  Both men say they have rejected a dozen job offers 
since they developed Exodus. Some of the offers were at nearly twice their present salaries. Both 
said they preferred to remain in Boise. Computer Sciences even offered to create a special: branch 
office in Boise for the pair, but they still said no.
