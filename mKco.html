The <b>IBM 1620</b> was introduced in 1959 and marketed as an inexpensive "scientific computer". It was a general-purpose, stored-program data processing system for small businesses, research and engineering departments of large companies, and schools requiring solutions to complex problems in the areas of engineering, research, and management science.
&nbsp; 
It was used to run the Critcal Path Method for managing large construction projects.</font>
