<b>Data Process Machine Installed; <br>Idaho Hires Nerve Center Chief</b><br>Idaho Statesman December 3, 1969

</center><br>

A small section of basement in the new state office building is scheduled soon to become the nerve center of state operations.
Equipment for the center, headquarters of the state's data processing operations, began arriving this week and installation was under way under supervision of the Division of Management Services.
<br><br>At the same time, Ray Clovis, head of management services announced the hiring of a director of data processing, Lou L. Marsden, 40.
<br><br>Marsden, a native of Salt Lake City, was formerly senior member of the advisory staff of Atomic Energy Commission operations at Richland, Wash. He has been associated with electronic data processing since 1951. He holds a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics from Utah State University, Logan, and a master's degree in mathematics from the University of Idaho.
Marsden was stationed at the National Reactor Test Site with Phillips Petroleum Co. in Eastern Idaho from 1954 through 1966,
<br><br>The first full-scale testing of the equipment, which will be provided the state on a contract lease basis by Univac, is expected to begin around Dec. 22, according to Clovis.
It will then undergo a 60-day trial period and another 30-day acceptance period before the state takes over its operations, Clovis said. The equipment consists of three basic machines, a Univac 494 and two Univac 9300s. Clovis noted the 494 model has the same speed as the world's largest computer.
<br><br>The center will be Idaho's second largest computer operation, exceeded in size by only the data processing system of the Atomic Energy Commission at the NRTS.
Clovis said he will schedule demonstrations of computer capabilities for legislators when they arrive here in mid-January. The center initially will service 15 or 16 state agencies, the larger of which include the departments of highways, law enforcement, health, public assistance and the State Tax Commission.
Marsden said he anticipates the hiring of two or three additional key personnel for the center by Jan. 1.
