<center><b>Warehouse </b><br>Idaho Statesman March 12, 1961</center>
<p>
The largest warehouse building in Idaho, and one of the biggest structures in the NorthWest will be dedicated next 
Sunday in Boise by a wholesale grocery firm. The new warehouse of Mountain States Wholesale company at Eleventh 
and River streets, has 95,000 square feet of floor space. It is big enough to accommodate two football games 
at one time, with four tennis doubles matches along the sidelines or would be if it wasn't full of groceries. 
The 20-foot clear span ceiling provides nearly two million cubic feet of storage space. The building, completed 
last November at a cost of $750,000, can receive six railroad cars of merchandise at one side and at the same 
time load or receive from 13 trucks on the other side of the building.<br><br>
Part of the new building is an attractive block of offices in a red brick structure. Housed in part of this 
building is a Univac 60 data processing machine. The enormous inventory control task involving carload quantities 
of merchandise in the warehouse makes the use of electronic computers necessary.
