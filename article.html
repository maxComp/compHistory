<center><b>Computers Perform Multiple Jobs for Varied Boise Firms</b><br>Idaho Statesman June 25, 1967</center><br>

<p>
Use of computers is widely practiced in Boise, but the uses being made of the costly and complicated machines are 
as varied as the types of companies using them.
"Some companies just use them as large bookkeeping machines," said Fred Keller, director of data processing at 
Boise College.  "They just have a computer so that they can look progressive and modern in the eyes of the public," 
he noted. More than 20 Boise firms now utilize some type of computer in daily transactions and research and, to 
some extent, job training. In addition, several governmental units have the "gadgets"<br><br>
There are also 12 suppliers, in the business of part time or full time selling the computers and data processing 
supplies to the local computer users.
Idaho's first home-grown entry into the data processing field is Boise Cascade Corp., Originally a wood products dealer,
"Our people's skill in computer technology resulted in a translator program developed during 1966 which is now 
being marketed under the name Exodus by Computer Sciences Corporation," said a statement in the firm's annual report.
Developed by two Boise computer-men, Exodus is a series of computer cards which "tells" an IBM 360 computer how 
to assimulate the data formerly stored on smaller computer units.
It has been sold to six other companies to date, the annual report said, on a royalty basis, Boise Cascade also has 
been using its computers to decide allocation of logs at its sawmills and plywood plants to the most profitable end-uses.
Computer men at the firm have built complicated models of the company to aid management in making decisions affecting 
future operations. The models allow company officials to test the decisions on the machine model instead of in reality.<br><br>
The Idaho First National Bank considered data processing so important that it built its own Data Processing Center at 
Twenty-seventh and Main last year. Delivered in 1966
Bank President William E. Irvin said that: In September (1966) we accepted delivery of the newest and largest data 
processing system in the state. The pre-installation, conversion and new equipment costs have been substantial; but 
the ultimate savings are such that these costs will be recovered and our future costs stabilized as well, thus 
protecting Our future profit margins.
One of the many challenges confronting banks in recent years is finding a way to handle the ever increasing volume 
of activity with greater speed and efficiency. This year we will handle over 50 million checks and deposits.
 First Security Bank and the Bank of Idaho also utilize computers in their operations. First Security, in fact, has 
an order for optical reading equipment capable of mechanically reading any combination of numbers printed with a 
common lead pencil.<br><br>
Boise College has recognized the fast-growing computer field by installing a trial two - year course in data processing 
beginning last fall.
"A fair amount of our kids now have part-time jobs in data processing," Keller said. "I would say that so far it has 
been a very successful course."
The college's machine is used "primarily" as a training device for the data processing students, Keller said, but it has 
many other uses. "These include keeping all student records for the college and next year, doing the business office's 
transactions," he noted.
Freshman engineering students now are learning how to program computers in addition to business and accounting 
students. Keller said that use of the computer eventually may be integrated with other courses at the school such as science.
<br><br>
As a practical problem for his data processing students, Keller had them set up a model program to aid the Boise Public 
Library in determining which books are overdue. The library is now using the college computer regularly to find its 
procrastinating book borrowers. The city of Boise is currently considering hiring time on a commercial computer for 
its work. 
<br><br>The users and sellers of computers have organized the Central Idaho Chapter, Data Processing Management 
Association. Firms belonging to the DPMA include: Albertson's, Bank of Idaho, Boise Cascade, Boise College, Burroughs 
Corp., Continental Life and Accident, First Security, Fisher's Office Equipment, Inc., Grange Mutual Life of 
Nampa, ldaho Data Management Services, Idaho First National Bank, Idaho Hospital Service, Idaho Power Co., 
Intermountain Gas Co., IBM Corp., Link's School of Business, Moore Business Forms, Morrison - Knudsen Co., 
Mountain States Telephone, Mountain States Wholesale, National Cash Register, Office Service-Center, Ore-Ida Foods, 
Pioneer Business Forms, Rife, Wilson and Pryzbylski, J. R. Simplot Co., Snake River Mutual Insurance Co., 
State of Idaho, Strawn's Office Supply, Inc., Syms-York Co., J. A. Terteling and Sons, Inc., UARCO Business Forms Co.,
 and UNIVAC.
