The <b>HP 2116A</b> Introduced in 1966, design and development of the 2116A was completed in a single year - lightning speed by product development cycle standards of the day (and also a good case study of effective organisational structures). This new computer was accompanied by a full suite of software at introduction, also very unusual for the time. The 2116A could be programmed in either FORTRAN or assembly language. The 2116A was the industry's second 16-bit minicomputer (Computer Control Company's DDP 116 introduced in April, 1965 was the first).
