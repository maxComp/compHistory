banking system, he said. Initially, only the accounting work of the Boise Valley branch offices will be automated 
and then Eastern and Northern Idaho branches will be brought into the program.

Fifty-five people will be employed at the center which features $430,000 in IBM equipment including the System 360. 
The 360 computer can process up to 1,600 checks and deposit tickets a minute, 1,100 lines of bank statements or 
eight adding machine - type tapes at 1,400 lines per minute, officials said.
The computer stores information on magnetic disk files and has access to this data at up to 312,000 digits per second. 
A total of 43.5 million digits of storage are available to the 360 at any one time, officials said.
<br><br>Data from the bank's Eastern And Northern Idaho branch offices Will be accumulated in satellite data centers to be 
located in Idaho Falls, Lewiston and Coeur d'Alene.
This information will be transmitted from a computer at the three points across telephone lines to the host
