The <b>IBM 1401</b> Data Processing System introduced in 1959 was a 
stored-program transistor-logic computer, it was IBM's first affordable general-purpose computer.  
The 1401 was host to one of the earliest high-level business-oriented programming languages, RPG (Report Program Generator)
, which increased its usability and popularity.  
<br>The first
applications for this computer at Boise Cascade were Payroll and Accounting. 
<br> The computer was installed on the ground floor of the Sun Building at 10th and Main Streets.
